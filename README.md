# AirQualityVictoria

Twitter bot designed to post updates on air quality in Victoria directly 
from the Victorian EPA. Can be used as a 'daily weather check' for 
people suffering respiratory conditions as a result of bushfire smoke 
and pollution in Victoria.

Please note this is a work in progress and may not be up to date at 
present. 

You can find the bot here: https://twitter.com/airqualityvic
